In this project we will use fortran to solve the advection-diffusion PDEs numerically using 4 finite difference schemes and then display and analyze the results in python

ToDo:
1. write fortran portion
2. debug
3. write python to display results
4. refine issues in fortran code
5. prettify plots
6. write report
7. do extra credit
8. revise report
